## Problem Statement

### Project Description

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on travelling possibilities and present a more unique, personalised way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analysed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behaviour and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more. This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix of categorical and numeric values. Explore and analyse the data to discover key understandings.

### BUSINESS PROBLEM OVERVIEW

As Airbnb continues to be a leading global travel platform with millions of listings and users, ensuring an exceptional customer experience and high engagement among hosts is crucial for the company's success. The business problem is to use data analysis to discover key understandings from the dataset containing approximately 49,000 observations and 16 columns of both categorical and numeric values. The goal is to identify insights that can guide strategic decision-making and improvements in various aspects of the platform.

## Business Objective

Enhancing Customer Experience and Increasing Host Engagement on Airbnb Platform

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis has provided valuable insights into the hotel bookings and customer preferences in different locations and room types. Several areas have been identified where improvements are needed to enhance customer experience and increase bookings:

It is evident that there is a significant number of rooms that have not been reviewed (5643 rooms). Ensuring prompt and proactive feedback collection from customers can help address any issues and improve overall service quality.

The average room price of unreviewed rooms being 124 suggests a potential need for better pricing strategies to attract more customers and gain their valuable feedback.

The low booking rate for Shared Rooms indicates the necessity to explore ways to make these accommodations more appealing and attractive to customers.

Despite Bronx and Staten Island receiving good average reviews from customers, their low booking rates necessitate targeted marketing efforts to increase their popularity and occupancy.

The observation that Queens has a high number of hotels but low bookings highlights the importance of understanding customer preferences and expectations in this location to boost occupancy rates.

Customer feedback has been identified as a crucial aspect that requires greater attention. Listening to customers' opinions and addressing their concerns will foster better relationships and improve overall guest satisfaction.

On the other hand, the analysis has identified certain aspects that have performed well compared to others:

Hotels like "Home away from home," "Hillside Hotel," and "New York Multi-unit building" have been booked frequently, indicating their popularity among customers. Identifying the reasons for their success and applying similar strategies to other accommodations could lead to increased bookings.

Manhattan's location has shown exceptional performance with the highest number of bookings. Understanding the factors contributing to its popularity could help replicate its success in other areas.

Williamsburg Area's high number of locations indicates its potential as a sought-after destination. Leveraging this information can lead to better marketing and increased bookings.

Home/apt room types have shown a higher number of stays, suggesting that customers prefer this accommodation type. Focusing on promoting and expanding this category may yield positive results.

In conclusion, by addressing the areas that need improvement while capitalizing on the factors that have performed well, hotel operators can enhance the overall customer experience, increase bookings, and achieve greater success in the hospitality industry.
